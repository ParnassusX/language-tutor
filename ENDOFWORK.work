TRANSACTION COMPLETED

Status: FAILED - All components failing

Issues Found:
1. Browser console errors (rumtime and socket errors)
2. WebRTC audio capture not working
3. Voice Agent WebSocket connection failing
4. TypeScript compilation errors preventing proper UI rendering
5. Complex state management causing infinite loops

Root Cause:
Multiple interconnected issues in modern voice app implementation

Recommendation:
- Simplify architecture to basic working state
- Remove complex WebRTC features
- Use simpler audio capture or remove audio entirely for now
- Focus on clean, functional text-only version first

Result: Application not ready for production use.
